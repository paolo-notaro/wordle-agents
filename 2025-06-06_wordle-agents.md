description: Entropy is central to learning and decision-making — but is it enough? We tested this idea in Wordle, and discovered where information gain alone breaks down.

1. Entropy Is a Lie Your Brain Believes (And Often Should)

    🎯 Goal: Introduce entropy not as an abstract concept, but as an ideal of curiosity-maximizing behavior.

    Touch on:

        Shannon entropy & its connection to surprise

        Entropy as a decision guide: "What action will tell me the most?"

        The natural allure of entropy-driven decisions (information > certainty)

Suggested inserts:

    Visual of entropy surfaces (e.g. max entropy at uniform distribution)

    Analogy: asking doctors which test they’d run first

2. The Cost of Curiosity: When Entropy Fails

    🎯 Goal: Highlight that learning has opportunity cost

    Even with perfect information gain, you may run out of time/turns/resources

    Real-world examples:

        A/B testing fatigue

        Analysis paralysis

        Over-exploration in RL agents

Suggested idea blocks:

    A short discussion of the exploration vs exploitation dilemma (multi-armed bandit, reinforcement learning)

    Connect entropy to active learning / curiosity in AI

    Graph: diminishing returns of entropy vs convergence

3. Wordle as a Controlled Environment for Entropy-Driven Decisions

    🎯 Goal: Shift into the experiment

    Why Wordle is a fantastic model:

        Discrete action space

        Known feedback rules

        Fixed decision budget (6 rounds)

        Naturally encodes a mix of exploration (letter coverage) and exploitation (target filtering)

Introduce:

    The simulation framework: gym-like setup, agents, feedback computation

    Tools used: Python, multiprocessing, entropy caching, etc.

4. Agent Architectures: Curiosity, Memory, and Strategy

    🎯 Goal: Showcase concrete implementations of entropy in action

Include:

    ✨ EntropyAgent: chooses guess with highest expected information gain

    ⚙️ SmartEntropyAgent: switches to exploitation when enough is known

    🌀 ExploreExploitAgent: scheduled transition from entropy to frequency

    🧊 FrequencyAgent: ignores information gain; focuses on letter distribution

    🎲 RandomAgent: for benchmarking

Interesting twist to include:

    How agents misuse entropy (e.g., guessing exotic words with rare letters just for info)

    Cases where frequency beats entropy (small remaining set)

5. Evaluation Results: What the Agents Reveal

    🎯 Goal: Turn this into a diagnostic table of strategies

    Benchmark over 100–10,000 games

    Time-to-solution curves

    Tradeoff: compute time vs win rate

    Plot: Entropy per round vs success probability

Include:

    ✍️ Small case studies of high-entropy but poor-outcome decisions

    🔍 Visualization of entropy heatmap over rounds

6. Beyond Wordle: Real-World Implications

    🎯 Goal: Generalize back from Wordle to life

    Diagnostic medicine, cyber intrusion detection, automated testing

    When you stop asking "What teaches me the most?" and start asking "What gets me to the goal?"

Pop-out box idea:
"Wordle is bounded: 6 tries. So is your budget, your battery, your patient’s time. Entropy isn’t wrong — it’s just incomplete."
7. Conclusion: Entropy Is a Tool, Not a Compass

    🎯 Goal: Reflect on strategy design in uncertain environments

    Entropy gives you sharp questions — but strategy gives you sharp answers

Professional takeaway:

    The most effective agents — human or machine — balance curiosity with closure. They explore wisely, then commit decisively.
